Communication
1. We will have weekly (scrum) meetings in person, where all ten individuals will be present. 
2. In addition to these weekly meetings, each subteam (frontend and backend) will meet at least once a week in person. 
3. Outside of these meetings, we will maintain constant communication through social media. 
4. We will always notify everyone when we push to the Master Branch on Git.

Quality of work everyone wishes to achieve
1. We wish to achieve a high quality of work, where the code is not only well designed (avoids code smells, is well-documented, follows proper code conventions), but is also fully functional. 
2. We will comment code that is not easily readable.

Level of group participation and individual accountability everyone feels comfortable with 
1. We will each work to meet a weekly target and complete our individual task for the week.
2. We will all contribute to weekly discussions about our design and progress.
3. We all promise to listen to each otherâ€™s ideas with respect.
4. We all promise to do our work as best as we can and to put our best efforts towards this project as a whole.
5. We all promise to do our work on time and meet the deadlines we set for ourselves.
6. We all promise to ask for help if we need it.
